## Project Overview

This project is a simple blog platform where users can create posts, view a list of all posts, read individual posts, edit existing posts, and delete posts. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with data stored in an SQLite database. The frontend is built using React.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, SQLite, Cors, Body-parser
- **Frontend**: React, CSS
- **Deployment**: Heroku (for Backend), Netlify/Vercel (for Frontend)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm (v6+ recommended)
- Git

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avinash-18-art/Blog-Application-ZuAI.git
cd blog-application
Backend Setup
1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies:

└── package.json    

cd backend
npm install
2. Run the Server
Start the Express server:


node server.js
The backend server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

3. Database
This project uses SQLite as the database. The database is created in-memory, so it resets every time the server restarts. You can modify the database.js file to use a persistent SQLite file if needed.

Frontend Setup
1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:


cd frontend
npm install
2. Run the React Application
Start the React development server:


npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Running the Application
Backend: Runs on http://localhost:5000
Frontend: Runs on http://localhost:3000

API Endpoints
GET /posts: Fetch all posts
GET /posts/:id: Fetch a specific post by ID
POST /posts: Create a new post
PUT /posts/:id: Update a post by ID
DELETE /posts/:id: Delete a post by ID
Connecting Frontend to Backend
The React frontend makes HTTP requests to the Express backend using fetch or axios. Make sure both servers are running and the frontend is configured to point to the correct backend API URL.

Deployment
Backend Deployment
You can deploy the backend to platforms like Heroku, Render, etc.

Push your backend code to GitHub.
